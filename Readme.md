# Pizza Store Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Tech stack used:
1. Microsoft PowerBI
2. Microsoft Excel

## Description

A major Pizza chain in India wanted to see how they have been performing after starting their business. I created this dashboard where they would get an overall glimpse of how their store is performing over time, what kind of product is sold more and which products need more improvement. The analysis also helps me figure out which of their collections and offers are running more and how they can set their pricing strategy to increase their overall Return on Investment.
